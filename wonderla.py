        This section mirrors a buyer's mindset when selecting products across different categories. It focuses on essential factors influencing their decisions:

        1. **Quality-Oriented Choices:** Preference for products with high average ratings and a substantial number of reviews to ensure reliability and quality.
        2. **Avoidance of Low-Rated or Under-Reviewed Products:** Products with fewer ratings or reviews are avoided due to potential credibility issues.
        3. **Budget Constraints:** Adherence to budget limitations is vital, guiding the selection process and preventing overspending.
        4. **Consideration for Exceptional Products:** Products with fewer reviews but exceptionally high ratings might still be considered for their outstanding performance.

        Creating a Selection Scoring Mechanism:
        To streamline decision-making, a scoring mechanism incorporates three primary factors:
        1. **Average Rating:** Given higher priority, emphasizing superior-rated products.
        2. **Number of Reviews:** Indicates comfort with higher-reviewed products.
        3. **Budget Threshold:** Maintaining a specified budget limit (e.g., $200).

        The 'Score' column, derived from these factors, helps identify products aligned with the buyer's preferences. The resulting data showcases products meeting these criteria while adhering to the specified budget.

        """
        This section delves into the realm of marketing insights by harnessing product-related data to derive valuable insights instrumental in shaping marketing strategies and decisions.

        **Data Preprocessing:**
        Relevant columns crucial for marketing analysis are extracted, including attributes like 'Title', 'Num Of Reviews', 'Average Rating', 'Price', 'Stock', 'Color Category', 'Manufacturer', and individual star ratings ('Five Star', 'Four Star', 'Three Star', 'Two Star', 'One Star'). The 'Price' column undergoes preprocessing, standardizing its format and converting it to float values for accurate analysis.

        **Aggregating Insights:**
        Grouping the data by product titles ('Title'), essential metrics are aggregated, encompassing cumulative reviews ('Num Of Reviews'), average ratings ('Average Rating'), and total counts for individual star ratings. This structured dataset provides a comprehensive overview of product performance, aiding in deriving actionable marketing insights.

        **Analyzing Rating Distribution:**
        A histogram showcasing the distribution of average ratings is plotted, excluding products with a 0 rating. This visualization enables a deeper understanding of the frequency distribution of ratings across different products.

        **Review Distribution by Rating:**
        A bar chart depicting the total number of reviews corresponding to each star rating (One Star to Five Star) is presented. This visualization offers a clear depiction of the volume of reviews received across various rating categories, providing insights into customer sentiments and preferences.

        These visualizations and data aggregations serve as pivotal resources for marketing professionals and stakeholders, offering a comprehensive understanding of product performance, customer satisfaction, and areas warranting marketing attention or enhancement.
